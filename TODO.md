# TODO

[] implement cursor
 [] view triggered selection update
 [] text replace views selection update

[] process externall operations (re-link, update cursor, re-render)






## legacy
- make all operations as children of Container



- (low) bug when running form commandline swift test "'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Can't modify an immutable model.'"


## maybe
// TODO (post): maybe replace peer ID with... nothing and use ophash as 3rd item to compare




## Done
- try model on top of a model so we can cross link
